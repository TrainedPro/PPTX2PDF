# PPTX2PDF
Simple python file that converts all ".pptx" files into ".pdf" files and them merges them into one file

## Usage
Install a module using "python -m pip install PyPDF2"
Change the input folder to whatever folder you have your ".pptx" files in

## Warning!
The last loop will delete all the old ".pdf" files when one merged file is created, to avoid this, remove those 2 lines. I will not be responsible for the loss of any wanted files

## Optional
You can stop the individual ".pdfs" from being deleted by removing the last loop entirely.
Additionally you can changed the output file name to something else.
